# 2-Bit-Full-Adder-using-Logic-Gates-in-Proteus
2-Bit Full Adder using Logic Gates.
This Project has a circuit that is made with really simple logic gates. The user gives the input in the form of two bits, the circuit adds the bits and then shows the output in the form of an output bit and the carry bit(if applicable). You can check for other amazing and unchellenging circuits at www.theengineeringprojects.com .
